Somewhere in the deserts of North America in a small provincial town, 

lived a prospector named Joe. 

Because of the not very rich lands he was all in debt, 

to pay them off he went to the mine again and began to dig a new route. 

He did not know that on his way there was a large hole of "natural origin"...
